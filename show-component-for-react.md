# Show component for React

As a React developer, you know that conditional rendering is a task that comes up all the time. While you can always rely on basic inline conditional logic (using && and ternary operators), things can get messy when you have multiple elements that need to render or not render.  
  
To make conditional UI rendering simpler and more declarative, I've adopted a custom Show component for my projects. Here's how it works:  
The Show component accepts React elements wrapped in a When and Else component for conditional logic.  
  
Now, say goodbye to the verbosity of condition ? "When true" : "Else case". Embrace the elegance and simplicity of the Show component for a more streamlined and intuitive approach to conditional rendering in your React projects.  
No more parsing complex ternary statements or logical operators to figure out what will actually render!
